# Cyber-Infrastructure for Complex Community Detection in Large-scale Networks
# CI_CCD_LSN

Web-site for a collaboration between David Bader's Group at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and the team of Tandy Warnow & George Chacko at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

The goal of this project is to develop cyber-infrastructure for scalable graph analytics. By this, we refer to graphs in the order of 10 million - 1 billion vertices.

This site is being actively developed. In addition, to code that will be archived here, we will also aggregate components of the following repositories.
