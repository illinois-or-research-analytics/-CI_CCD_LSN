Web-site for Developing Collaboration between David Bader's Group at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and the team of Tandy Warnow & George Chacko at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The goal of this project is to develop cyber-infrastructure for scalable graph analytics. By this, we refer to graphs in the order of 10 million - 1 billion vertices.

This site is being actively developed.
